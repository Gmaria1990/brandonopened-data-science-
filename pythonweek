Put your name and a brief reflection on what you think of Github! 
Brandon: Github can be confusing but I love how it keeps track of changes! 
This is during the live class! 
Harlan Elrich:  I really like this. I am very impressed with how easy it is to use. Unfortunately, I think it would take a lot of time to learn it really well.  I would like to be able to spend some time learning it, but I just don't have the time to do that.
